        When deciding on a professional craftsman to provide you with painting
        services or handyman repairs, you want someone who can get in quick, get
        the job done right, do quality work at a reasonable price, and then get
        out. We understand. You want a trustworthy, reliable, affordable and
        competent company who will treat you like they’d treat their own family.
        A company who stands behind their work; a company who has your best
        interest at heart. And mostly, a company you can feel good about, and
        recommend to your friends. We are that company. Listen, we know you’ve
        got many choices here in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida"
          >Gainesville FL</a
        >. We know other
        <a href="http://www.portland-painters.com/">painters</a> and handymen
        here in the area who are good honest people, and do good work. We’re not
        saying we’re the only ones in town you can trust with your biggest
        investment and most prized possession – your home. We’re just saying
        that we are one of the elite painting companies in Gainesville. See, you
        can’t really say you’re ‘the best in town’… because we’re only talking
        about house painting and home improvement here. We’re not building a
        rocket ship to go to the moon. You can only reach a certain level of
        expertise. And we’re not the only ones who have reached that level. So
        what separates us from the few other good craftsmen in town? Affordable
        quality work. Honest and trustworthy. Prompt, fast and efficient. We
        respond with alacrity. We bring the right attitude. We’ve got a sense of
        humor. We don’t take ourselves too seriously, even though we take our
        work very seriously. We’ve got a good perspective on life. And best of
        all, we can hold an intelligent conversation on just about any topic! In
        other words, we bring the ‘whole package’ to the table. We’re the guys
        you want your daughters to marry. And how many painters can you say that
        about? I mean, really. C’mon. We love what we do, and we always strive
        for 100% customer satisfaction. For any home or business improvement or
        repair, call today.
